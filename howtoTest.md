Your `package.json` file is mostly set up for your React Vite app, but to ensure you're fully ready for unit and integration testing, especially for your login page, signup, and API tests, there are a few key considerations and additions.

### What you already have:

- **Jest**: This is your testing framework (`jest` in `devDependencies`), which is widely used for unit and integration testing.
- **@types/react** and **@types/react-dom**: These are TypeScript types for React, which will help with type-checking in your tests (if you're using TypeScript).
- **React Testing Library**: Though you don't have it listed yet, this library is highly recommended when working with React. It provides utilities to test components in a way that simulates user interactions, which would be important for your login and signup form tests.

### Additional suggestions:

To cover all bases for your testing needs, you might want to add the following dependencies:

1. **React Testing Library** (`@testing-library/react`):

   - This will allow you to test your React components by rendering them in a test environment and simulating user interactions.
   - Install:
     ```bash
     npm install @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom @testing-library/user-event
     ```

2. **Mock Service Worker (MSW)**:

   - For testing APIs and mocking server responses, MSW is a great tool to simulate network requests without actually hitting the backend.
   - Install:
     ```bash
     npm install msw
     ```

3. **Jest Setup for React Testing**:
   - You may need to configure Jest for testing React components and enable certain features (like `jest-dom` for DOM assertions).
   - You can create a `jest.setup.js` file and include things like:
     ```javascript
     import "@testing-library/jest-dom";
     ```

### Example `devDependencies` additions:

```json
"devDependencies": {
  ...
  "@testing-library/react": "^13.0.0",
  "@testing-library/jest-dom": "^5.0.0",
  "@testing-library/user-event": "^14.0.0",
  "msw": "^1.2.0"
}
```

### Jest Configuration:

If you haven't already configured Jest with Babel or other necessary tools, you may need a `jest.config.js` file with setup for React. For example:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  testEnvironment: "jsdom",
  setupFilesAfterEnv: ["<rootDir>/jest.setup.js"],
  transform: {
    "^.+\\.jsx?$": "babel-jest",
    "^.+\\.tsx?$": "ts-jest",
  },
};
```
